  content: 'A VIP has been murdered. I need you to investigate a lead.


    Details
    are strictly need-to-know and the autopsy is pending, but we believe it was made
    to look like a suicide. Prior to their death, the victim opened a message on
    their computer. The contents were corrupted after the fact, but we were able
    to determine it contained one file: listen.wav


    The file''s metadata referenced
    a website known as Soundwav.com which went offline less than a week ago, taking
    all of its files with it.


    This is too specific to be a coincidence.


    We''ve
    provided an archived copy of the site. You need to find who sent the message.


    From
    what was recovered, the file''s author is "BleakMusic" but anyone could have
    downloaded it.


    Because an account is needed to download files, the our
    suspect must have an account on this site. Find their username and send it to
    me. I''ll take care of the rest.


    Jim'
