    While there is limited data on who
    exactly "Poxel" is, we already have a list of likely candidates. They will be
    aprehended soon.


    As for the others affected by this "song", we''ve taken
    your notes into consideration. Those who we know have access to the file will
    be followed up on. The survivors of this ordeal we will need to handle will care.


    But
    you don''t need to worry about those details. You''ve earned your payment.


    As
    usual, provide your credentials <b><here></b> and you will receive your compensation.


    Till
    we speak again.


    Jim'
