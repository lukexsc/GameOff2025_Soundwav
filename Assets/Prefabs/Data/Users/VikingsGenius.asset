  bio: 'We''re VikingsGenius, an indie math rock band (it''s not as nerdy as it sounds...
    but it''s still pretty nerdy). We hail from the northest USA and sometimes do
    shows. Follow us for updates on that on our other socials. If you like geeking
    out over complicated compositions that sound awesome, you''ve come to the right
    place.


    (If you see me in comments it''s probably me, Todd, one of the guitarists)'
