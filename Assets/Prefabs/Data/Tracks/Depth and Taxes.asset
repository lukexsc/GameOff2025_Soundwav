  description: Remix of "Death and Taxes" by The Libertines. This had a chorus that
    was begging for a big drop so I added more build-up and messed with the baseline.
    I also filtered the vocals because it ended up sounding cool.

    content: It turned out alright. I'm not much for bass-bumping music like this,
      it's a bit too much, but if you like it, it seems good.
