    (Updates will be posted in chat)


    Lexi here.
    We don''t normally do this, but this really isn''t normal. There''s a track going
    around the site that the Admin and moderators are taking down en masse. Please
    listen for all the details and how you can avoid your account getting taken down,
    or worse.'

    content: Admin tagged me in to scroll through the site for any re-uploads of
      the site while they look at the back-end. Please message me if you find anything!
  - username: CzarCzar
    content: I don't get what the big deal is. Is the site in legal trouble or something?
  - username: Pizzicatoty
    content: Not sure what's going on, but I saw The_Word_Underscore has been adding
      a bunch of stuff back.
  - username: Troubadource
    content: '@NocturneIdol I can see that you uploaded the banned song from your
      friend The_Word_Underscore, but his account is suspended. Do you know anything
      about where it came from?'
  - username: Troubadource
    content: I've eliminated every copy of the song that I can find and I think I
      found the source. The earliest upload is from @BleakMusic and metadata from
      all the reposts I've seen indicates they downloaded it from them.
  - username: Troubadource
    content: '@BleakMusic What is this song? Where did you get it? And, importantly,
      do you still have the file?'
  - username: BleakMusic
    content: I don't know what's going on! You seem to have a better idea of what's
      happening than I do! I have it still, do you want it?
  - username: Troubadource
    content: NO! Delete it right now! Defragment your drive too.
  - username: BleakMusic
    content: OK OK I will! Look this is all I know. There's a local band I'm a big
      fan of called Clods of the Valley. They're an kind of indie rock/folk band
      with a lot of psychedelic/acid rock influnce. They make weird stuff that's
      really deep and personal. They recently released a new song on their website
      without much fanfare called "I Don't Miss It". I want to help promote them
      so I uploaded it to my account as soon as I could.
  - username: Troubadource
    content: And you haven't listened to it? You don't know what might be weird about
      it? What it does to people?
  - username: Folkie
    content: Woah woah! What do you mean "what it does to people"? My friend ChalkRock
      might have listened to it? Is he OK?
  - username: BleakMusic
    content: I'm telling you, I didn't listen to it. It's weird they didn't post
      anything on social media after releasing it. That's something they normally
      do. And their website seems to be down now. Not sure what happened.
  - username: Troubadource
    content: That's probably for the best.
  - username: Troubadource
    content: '@Folkie I don''t have specifics, but from what I''ve been reading and
      hearing from Admin''s couple messages, people seem to have negative reactions
      to hearing it. Very negative. Sometimes people comment something cryptic or
      morbid and then log off. Other seem to keysmash and stay online doing nothing.
      Others, like ChalkRock don''t mention anything. Nobody has heard back from
      anyone.'
  - username: Tuottor
    content: Holy...
  - username: Troubadource
    content: The scary thing is, we have no idea how many people could have downloaded
      it before it got taken off the site. It's popped up enough I'm worried people
      still have it.
  - username: Folkie
    content: Wait a second, how could anyone have downloaded it from Bleak in the
      first place? Only friends are notified for uploads and I didn't even get in
      before it happened.
  - username: Tuottor
    content: There might be a way. @BleakMusic, is that bot account you found still
      around?
  - username: Folkie
    content: Bot account?
  - username: Tuottor
    content: ChalkRock found it a while ago, it had copies of every track Bleak uploaded
      plus some other, probably from other accounts. It uploaded sometimes minutes
      after Bleak did so we assumed it was a bot.
  - username: BleakMusic
    content: Yeah, it's still around. I assumed Admin was too busy to deal with it
      at the time.
  - username: Troubadource
    content: What is it's name?
  - username: BleakMusic
    content: '@NoteSerenity'
  - username: Folkie
    content: Sure, but isn't that the same problem? All these tracks were deleted
      pretty soon after Admin found out. Someone would need to see notifications
      for the PSA update from SoundwavPodcast AND NoteSerenity.
