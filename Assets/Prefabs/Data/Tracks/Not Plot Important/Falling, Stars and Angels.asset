    [I''ll update
    with my thoughts when I''ve listened to this. I''m really hopeful since this
    is the first single they''ve released in a long time and I love love LOVED their
    last epic track]'

    content: Well it's certainly... ambient.

    content: I shouldn't have let a seven minute song with a provoking title get
      my hopes up. There's nothing of substance to grab onto, you just fall into
      a pit of vaguely catchy electronica.

    content: 'UGH. OK I have nothing against electronic music, but I''m kind of with
      Tuotter that this is the sort of song that just exists to build up to a drop,
      like for a commercial or trailer. '
  - username: Folkie
    content: Honestly, this might actually be for a trailer, they had a different
      producer for this who frequently works with movie studios.

    content: you're all so pretentious. this is banger
