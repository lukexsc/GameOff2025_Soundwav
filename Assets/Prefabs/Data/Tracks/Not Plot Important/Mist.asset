  description: I wanted to make something to play in the background when I'm running
    my campaign. I tried to find anything that had a creepy fairytale vibe but couldn't
    find anything that I liked. I might make a longer version since it's a bit short
    to loop during a game.

    content: Good composition! I get that you want it to be a bit longer so it doesn't
      get stale or repetative, but the transition in the loop is really smooth and
      I feel like it's the perfect length right now.

    content: Oh cool, I didn't know you were running a D&D campaign. Looking for
      any players?

    content: '@VikingsGenius I really appreciate the praise, especially coming from
      you. I''ll have to see how it sounds in the moment and if I need to vary it.
      I might just right more music for different situations, but that seems like
      a lot of work'

    content: '@Andanterbli It''s Pathfinder actually. And unfortunately I''m already
      running for six, adding someone else in at this point in the campaign would
      be a huge hassle.'

    content: lol that's fair, I knew it was a bit of a long shot.

    content: If you ever need people for a one-shot or another game just know I'm
      down whenever

    content: Heard. You'll be on the short list.
