  description: 'Alas, Alas by Forest and the Trees


    [I''m not usually one for
    indie folk rock, but Folkie swears by the band so here''s their new song. @Folkie
    I promise I''ll put my thoughts here when I listen to it.]'

    content: 'Ah, Forest and the Trees, my beloved <3

      Please listen to it
      when you get the chance, it may not be your usual cup of tea but their music
      deals with a lot of dark subjects when you think about the lyrics.'

    content: I didn't realize FatT was still making music; I haven't listened to
      them in years. But this was a pleasant surprise, a song nominally expressing
      grief but clearly all an act to elicit sympathy and acquire power. Perhaps
      I should give them a second chance.

    content: I stg I read "FarT"

    content: You should! Why did you stop listening to them?

    content: The Harvesttide album was both bad and had some deeply uncomfortable
      subtext especially with the new about the songwritter and their fans. I couldn't
      really justify listening after that
  - username: Folkie
    content: Oh yeah, that's more than fair, everyone hated that album. The band
      split for months over that but they got the band back together minus the problematic
      ones and have reached their stride again.

    content: lol this is the Folie-est song I've ever heard. Not my thing but I see
      why you like it
