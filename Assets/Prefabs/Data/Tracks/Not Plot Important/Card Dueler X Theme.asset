  description: I can find posts of the original series everywhere but nobody seems
    to have posted the sequel series anywhere. For as mid as this series was, the
    OP was honestly way too good.

    content: This is so nostalgic, I love it.
  - username: LostMedian
    content: YES, CDX was my favorite growing up. Thank you for your service to the
      preservation of art!
  - username: LostMedian
    content: Hey, what do you mean "mid" CDX was so much cooler than CD
  - username: Andanterbli
    content: You are entitled to your opinion. But I liked how the original show
      was more willing to do dark plots and put the characters in danger. For all
      the "cool" aesthetic added in X it all felt really shallow.
  - username: Andanterbli
    content: Also I didn't appreciate it at the time, but the fact the dub editted
      the original to replace all the gay relationships with het ones is really blantant
      in hindsight. It literally creates plot holes.
  - username: Gertsin
    content: Growing up I definitely didn't hate it, but I think the theme song might
      have been why
  - username: Gertsin
    content: There was actually a lot of great music through X, actually. The battle
      theme was overused but good. And whenever it tried for a sad moment that string
      number was more effective than the writing ever was.

    content: '@Getsin, you''re totally right. @Andanterbli any chance you could upload
      one of those?'
  - username: Andanterbli
    content: I'll add them to The List.

    content: You all just lack good taste for saturday morning cartoons/anime
