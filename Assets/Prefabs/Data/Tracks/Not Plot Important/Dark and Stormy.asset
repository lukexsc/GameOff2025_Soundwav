  description: Long ambient track. I made this for a short film I want to make. The
    vibe is ominous with a sort of "medieval" feel.

    content: Thank you. As for the short film, I'm about halfway through the screenplay
      and I'm dealing with some writers block. Honestly, I made this to procrastinate
      on it. The idea is that it starts as a gothic horror plot, people acting strange,
      dark shadows, and lots of mirrors. The plot revolves around friends exploring
      this old house and going in literal mirror universes. But I'm having trouble
      ending the story.

    content: That's a very ambitious idea, but I like the premise. Have you made
      a short film like this before?
  - username: WCubeSQ
    content: To be honest, I haven't, but I want to give it a shot. I have a friend
      with a lot of film equipment who works in film so I was going to get her help.

    content: That sounds awesome! This song definitely fits that mirror vibe too.
      Can I read the script?
  - username: WCubeSQ
    content: Thanks Lost, but it's still an early draft so I'm not confident enough
      to show it to anybody.
