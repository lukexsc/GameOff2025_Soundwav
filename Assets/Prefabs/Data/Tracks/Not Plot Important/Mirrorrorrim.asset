  description: Another track for my prospective short film. This one is supposed
    to really emphasize the weirdness of moving through a mirror with a crazy time
    signature. I could also see it fitting the climax or a montage.

    content: Any progress on the script?

    content: A little. I've decided how I want it to end, but it's hard to figure
      out how I'm going to get there.

    content: I'm also going to need some serious revisions of the beginning. I can
      already tell that my eyes were bigger than my stomach. My film friend had a
      look over and gave me a better idea of what I can reasonably accomplish, which
      is good, but frustrating to know I'll have to rework so much.
