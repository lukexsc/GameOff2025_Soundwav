  description: 'Vengeance by Ostiarii


    I''ve never heard of this band but meatspace
    friend of mine recommended it as "If Dante''s Inferno was Bohemian Rhapsody"
    which, could you possibly not check *that* out? I don''t think it quite lived
    up to that reputation but it''s certainly unique. I love the choir, the organ,
    percusive flames. This would be a killer villain track.'

    content: I'm utterly shocked that you haven't heard of the Ostiarii before. Your
      past tracks suggest you have a soft spot for, as you say, "villain songs" (although
      that grossly misrepresents the content of the song which is all about the singer
      bringing those who commit the sin of revenge to justice which the dead accuse
      him is identical, but they prove their conviction by not retaliating at the
      end). Most of their works isn't online, they primarily believe in physical
      media, I have a vinyl of their first album. Admittedly, it makes them harder
      to get into, but I appreciate their dedication to the physical medium. But
      their later albums are easier to access, each one "advances" technology forward.
      "Vengeance" was released on CD. I suspect they will post online in their next
      album.

    content: This is epic! I totally get the Queen connection but this is so much
      more METAL! Has anybody uploading their older albums online? I'd love to hear
      it but I'm not going to get a phonograph or whatever

    content: That's really against the spirit of music, don't you think? The idea
      of lossily compressed mp3s of people recording a beautiful record on their
      phone being someone's first impression of the Ostiarii makes my skin crawl.

    content: And it isn't "metal" it's psychadelic rock, but they are influenced
      by a lot of industrial and avant-garde metal bands.
