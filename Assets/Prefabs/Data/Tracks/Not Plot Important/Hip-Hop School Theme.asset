  description: This show seems to be collectively forgotten by the internet, but
    I have fond memories of it growing up. You didn't see a lot of cartoons with
    people of color, especially in the 90s. The writing had... issues, but the theme
    song is apparetnly written by several real hip hop artists in the scene at the
    time who made it for free and apparently without credit. If anyone knows who
    worked on this, please let me know.

    content: 4 minutes? That's a long opening theme
  - username: Andanterbli
    content: It's the full version. They only use the first verse for the real opening,
      and I found that online. Finding the full version was more involved. I had
      to track down box set of it (which inexplicably does exist) that had bonus
      features.
  - username: Gertsin
    content: Really, nobody knows who made the song? It wasn't anywhere in the bonus
      features?
  - username: Andanterbli
    content: Sadly, not. It's almost they were embarassed about it.
  - username: Gertsin
    content: Huh, that's interesting. Smells like some sort of lost media thing @LostMedian
      would try and figure out

    content: O.O

    content: Honestly, given the moral panic around gangsta rap, I'm surprised this
      show was made at all.
