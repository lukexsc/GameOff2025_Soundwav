    content: You did a great job on this K, no need to be nervous.
  - username: KittyOstinato
    content: T_T thank you

    content: I will also hasten to assure you that this is great. It's frankly more
      polished than I was expecting, and you always go the extra mile to make things
      aesthetically pleasing. Your lyrics are evocative and your voice is clear and
      easy to understand. What inspired the lyrics?

    content: Oh man, I teared up a little.
  - username: KittyOstinato
    content: You're all so nice!

    content: This song is really about this story I've had in my head for a while.
      It's the end of the world, or, well it's kind of not clear, but this couple
      is there at then end looking back on everything. They're not perfect for each
      other, and they know it, but they love each other and wish they could share
      the future together but it no longer exists.

    content: That's interesting. I picked up on the apocalyptic themes but I didn't
      think they were that literal. I enjoyed the interpretation of this being a
      sad, but mutual breakup.
  - username: KittyOstinato
    content: That's totally a valid interpretation! Like I said, I didn't really
      see it as a super literal world ending, but definitely more of a Bad Thing
      going on in the world. Something inevitable.
  - username: KittyOstinato
    content: It's the sort of dramatic scene I love and would love to act out someday.
  - username: WCubeSQ
    content: Late to the party, but you did amazing. Someday we need to collaborate
      on something
