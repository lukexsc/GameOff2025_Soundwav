  description: This is a track a college friend commissioned me to make for one of
    their personal projects. I'll link it when he's done with it, but I was given
    the prompt of "cyberpunk antarctica" which inspired me to make this. Synths and
    electronic sounds aren't my forte but I like how it turned out.
