  description: By popular demand, the battle music for Card Dueler X. This is almost
    exactly the original but I had to edit it slightly in order to make it loop perfectly.
    I never noticed it watching the show, but there's a hiccup when it loops that
    you can't unhear once you notice.

    content: Never watched the show, but this actually rocks. I'm using this for
      battle music in my D&D campaign.

    content: You did it! Thank you, Anda! I'm going to jam to this while studying
      tonight.

    content: Woah! I rewatched some clips and you're right, it doesn't loop perfectly.
      If I ever make a video retrospective on the show I need to put in that detail.

    content: Let me know if you actually make that video.
