  description: 'Hollow by Breaking Dusk


    Javier really killed it on the baseline
    in this. And it wouldn''t be a Breaking Dusk track without eerie vocals. Amanda
    sounds like an actual tormented ghost (compliment). This song makes me feel like
    grooving in a graveyard, even if I''m pretty sure the song is just about a breakup.'

    content: Not a big fan of the rest of the album, but this song is great. Why
      they don't post their music here is a mystery to me. I feel like they'd be
      a lot more popular.
  - username: Folkie
    content: I kind of like that they're underground. Every time they've tried to
      appeal to a wider audience (e.g. Meet at Midnight) it just comes across as
      soulless.

    content: I'm saying people here would like their good stuff so they could be
      popular *and* not water it down. I think they deserve more fans
  - username: Folkie
    content: Sure, but then the lowest common denomenator is going to praise their
      stuff. It should really only be for people who are willing to put in the work.
      Their concerts already pull in a bunch of people who don't get it.
  - username: ChalkRock
    content: You make it sound like you want to lock the band up in your basement
      to only perform for you.
  - username: Folkie
    content: Don't be stupid. The noise complaints would get me evicted.
