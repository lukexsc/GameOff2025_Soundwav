  description: 'Stradivarius by The Defenestrations of Prague


    A rock ballad
    about love, rival bands, and time travel, what else could you want? This sounds
    like a forgotten 80s classic, which given it''s themes is appropriate. The plot
    is crazy but the lyrics are just so fun. When the whole band sings along in the
    chorus it sounds like the best sitcom intro music ever.'
  comments:
  - username: Folkie
    content: For those who don't know, the band members are all related and are a
      mix of young and old. I really appreciate their authenticity.
  - username: Tuotter
    content: This is unique. I'll have to check out the rest of their work.
