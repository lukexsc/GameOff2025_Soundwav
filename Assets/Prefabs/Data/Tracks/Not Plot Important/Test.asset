  description: I'm not really a music person, but I've been studying up on music
    theory for whatever reason so I wanted to try something out.

    content: Nice work, G! Are you looking for feedback at all, or are you just learning
      at your own pace? Obviously, I'm in a band, so I know a little bit of music
      theory (didn't study it either, but you know).

    content: 'I think you did a good job for a first time, there''s nothing obviously
      clashing, but I''d change a few things


      1) I think the mastering could
      be a bit better. Especially the volume of the relative tracks. The percussion
      is really loud and I think one guitar is quieter than the other.


      2)
      You have a lot of different ideas fit into this. And that''s good! Having different
      melodies is a great way to build out songs, but this is a lot. Save those hooks
      for other tracks and build off them


      3) Hand in hand with #2 I think
      you''re a bit afraid of repeating yourself, but songs are all about verse chorus
      verse chorus (at least pop songs are). I''d like a bit more structure. Combine
      elements together to keep interest but work with fewer pieces.'
