  - username: Admin
    content: I see it. Purging it now.
  - username: NotPop
    content: good work team
  - username: NotPop
    content: I feel like you're being sarcastic, but I'm just relieved we managed
      to find that out
  - username: Tuottor
    content: Still, we all need to log off soon in case something goes wrong. Or
      more wrong as the case may be.
  - username: NotPop
    content: man, I just realized I can't listen to music here anymore. this sucks
  - username: Folkie
    content: Genuinely, thank you all. I don't know if we helped much, but I'm glad
      we did something. Poxel still has the song so there's no telling who they're
      going to hurt with it. But I think at this point this problem is beyond us.
  - username: NotPop
    content: pretty sure this was beyond us from the beginning
  - username: Tuottor
    content: As triumphant as I am, I need to go to Chalk's place. I need to know
      what happened and likely call the police.
  - username: Folkie
    content: Oh... yeah. Wait! Make sure you bring ear plugs. And probably play some
      static or something to drown out the song if it's playing.
  - username: Tuottor
    content: Good idea. I hadn't considered the full implications of the song playing
      from speakers and not headphones. But I'm going to go now. I will text you
      Folkie to let you know I'm alright when it's over.
  - username: BleakMusic
    content: Be safe!
