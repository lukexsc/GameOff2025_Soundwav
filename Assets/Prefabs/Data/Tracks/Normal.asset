  - username: Kiazhit
    content: Finally, a re-upload that *wasn't* taken down. I can't believe the mods
      only searched based on name.
  - username: Folkie
    content: '@Tuottor @BleakMusic @Troubadource Found it. The upload was pretty
      soon after LostMedian pinged their friends about it. This might be the source
      for how it kept getting spread. Maybe this Kiazhit is the culprit.'
  - username: Tuottor
    content: Good find. That sounds likely.
  - username: Folkie
    content: '@Troubadource If you haven''t already you should delete this track
      or suspend the account entirely.'
  - username: Folkie
    content: '@Troubadource Hey, I know you''re busy, but this is important!'
  - username: Folkie
    content: He hasn't taken this long before. I'm getting worried.
  - username: Tuottor
    content: I just got pinged by NotPop of all people. I know you're pissed at him,
      but it's related to the poster of the first comment here and seems serious.
