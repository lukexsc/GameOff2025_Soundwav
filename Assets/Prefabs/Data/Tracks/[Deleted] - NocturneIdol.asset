  comments:
  - username: NocturneIdol
    content: First upload on behalf of The_Word_Underscore since Admin decided to
      go scorched earth. Never heard of this band or song before, whatever.
  - username: ChalkRock
    content: Thanks for the re-up! Not sure what the big deal, but if someone recommends
      me something, by heck or high water I'll track it down.
  - username: NocturneIdol
    content: Listening to this now I don't get what the admin's smoking saying this
      "violates the terms of service", I mean it's just borfvchnb[;]p'/

    content: Uh...
  - username: Folkie
    content: It's deleted again?! What is going on today, I've never seen so much
      admin activity.
  - username: Folkie
    content: '@ChalkRock you got a chance to listen to it, right? Is it something
      I''d like? At this point I''m ready to give up if you think it''s just mid.'
  - username: Folkie
    content: '@ChalkRock You there? It says you''re online. '
  - username: Folkie
    content: OK what is *actually* going on? @Tuotter have you heard anything from
      Chalk? If this is a prank I'll kill him.
  - username: Tuotter
    content: Then it's not just me. I was texting him but he hasn't replied. I'm
      going to call him
  - username: Folkie
    content: '@Troubadource What are you talking about? What do you know?'
  - username: Tuotter
    content: I called three times, he isn't picking up.
  - username: Troubadource
    content: Sorry, I'm getting a million @s. I don't know exactly what's going on
      but weird stuff is going on. Admin is taking down every song like this and
      people are trying to figure out what it is and why. The unofficial soundwav
      podcast put out a PSA about it like an hour ago. I'm just commenting on every
      one I can find.

    content: dumbest ARG I've ever heard of
  - username: Folkie
    content: This really isn't funny
  - username: Troubadource
    content: Not a joke. Look it up yourself
