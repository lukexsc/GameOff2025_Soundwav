  comments:
  - username: Folkie
    content: What happened to the track? I didn't even get to listen to it.
  - username: ChalkRock
    content: I've never seen this before, don't deleted tracks get removed from your
      account? Is this a bug?
  - username: BleakMusic
    content: Hi everyone, sorry about this. I don't know what happened. It looks
      fine when I uploaded it, description and all. But now I can't even upload it
      again or I get a warning.
  - username: Tuotter
    content: I've seen this before. This is when the admin removes something manually.
      Not sure why it stays, maybe to prevent you from re-uploading it?
  - username: ChalkRock
    content: '@Tuottor That''s wild, I didn''t know they did that. Wait so, what
      exactly was the song? @BleakMusic do you know why it was removed.'
  - username: BleakMusic
    content: I have no idea why it'd need to be taken down. Maybe it had something
      bad in it? I haven't actually listened to it so I'm not sure.
  - username: ChalkRock
    content: How did you not listen to it before uploading?
  - username: BleakMusic
    content: I upload them in batches, usually when my favorite bands release new
      tracks, like this one. It's just more convenient for me to listen to. Or it
      was.
  - username: Folkie
    content: Does anyone else have it? I'm really curious to hear it now!
  - username: The_Word_Underscore
    content: 'Found another one. Hey, so it looks like the admin is nuking things
      from orbit now. I think they''re friends with the band so they''re removing
      anything that violates their copyright. Pretty hypocritical since they leave
      tons of other re-uploads alone.


      I posted most of the tracks I found
      that the admin removed to my account.'
