  description: I know no one will see this, but uploading some random audio file
    as the first song on the site didn't sit well with me, hence this. Passion for
    music doesn't translate into skill and it especially didn't when I wrote this
    in college. It's not perfect but neither is this site. If I'm expecting people
    to share their art, I should act first, even behind the scenes.

  - username: NotPop
    content: just glad to be included, I guess
  - username: Folkie
    content: I'm still mad at you, but thank you for doing the right thing there
  - username: NotPop
    content: 'uh... thanks? you make it sound like I''d consider killing people for
      fun '

    content: Not to cut the banter short but @Admin @Admin @Admin
  - username: NotPop
    content: '@Admin im in ur base killin ur d00dz'
  - username: BleakMusic
    content: '@Admin before you ban us, please listen! There are people trying to
      hack your site!'
  - username: Admin
    content: You came to warn me about people hacking my site... by hacking my site?
  - username: Folkie
    content: There's no time! There are a bunch of people (@Kiazhit @Mechang @PauseNess
      @Popek and @ThrenodySkater) that are working with a hacker. They want to use
      the song to kill a bunch of people including people using the site. You need
      to stop them!
  - username: Admin
    content: I'm already on it. Despite the blocks I put up, people are still looking
      for and trying to upload the song. My mods aren't responding and I'm fearing
      the worst. But just tell me the hacker's username and I can remove the account
      from the database. It's not perfect but it gives me time to take down the whole
      site.
  - username: BleakMusic
    content: But the hacker and their friends might have downloaded the song already!
  - username: Admin
    content: I'm sorry to say that there's not much we can do about that. That problem
      is for later. Get me the username and I'll remove the account.
  - username: Tuottor
    content: Unfortunately, the hacker's account is... hacked. The data can't be
      accessed and it's dangerous to even try to load it. So, we don't know the username.
  - username: NotPop
    content: can't you just look it up?
  - username: Admin
    content: Not without triggering the same traps.
  - username: Folkie
    content: Is there nothing we can do then? Any work-around?
  - username: Admin
    content: Actually, there might be. There's a bug I've had yet to address. Private
      accounts sometimes can still see deleted or renamed accounts in their friends
      lists. If you can find a private account that's friends with the hacker, you
      should be able to see the hacker's username.
  - username: Folkie
    content: Got it. We'll see if his public friends have any leads. Keep an eye
      out, we'll @ you when we find it
