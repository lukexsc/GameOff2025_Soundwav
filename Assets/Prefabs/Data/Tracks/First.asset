  description: I know no one will see this, but uploading some random audio file
    as the first song on the site didn't sit well with me, hence this. Passion for
    music doesn't translate into skill and it especially didn't when I wrote this
    in college. It's not perfect but neither is this site. If I'm expecting people
    to share their art, I should act first, even behind the scenes.
