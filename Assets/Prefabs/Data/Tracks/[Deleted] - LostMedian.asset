    content: Apparently the mods are trying to purge this song from the internet.
      Just to be sure, someone reupload this--under a different name or something.
      We can't let censorship win!
  - username: Utopyruff
    content: Uh... no?
  - username: Gertsin
    content: I don't think deleting a track is censorship, I think that's literally
      the definition of what moderators are supposed to do.
  - username: Gertsin
    content: Also, you downloaded the file, right? It's not like it's lost.
  - username: Utopyruff
    content: Do you think the mods can't read? Like...
  - username: LostMedian
    content: But how are other people going to hear it? It's not just being lost
      it's being suppressed!
  - username: Gertsin
    content: Probably pretty easily. This is literally the Streisand effect.
  - username: LostMedian
    content: The what?
  - username: Gertsin
    content: Just look it up.
  - username: Gertsin
    content: I don't even get what the big deal. As far as I can tell this is over
      some sort of rights issue or offensive content from some two-bit folk band
      nobody's heard of.
  - username: Gertsin
    content: I guess it doesn't sound bad or anything I did before but I'm not scared
      anymore im not scared anymor4.. I Don;t missit hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
  - username: Troubadource
    content: Not another one... earliest so far.
  - username: Troubadource
    content: DO NOT LISTEN TO THIS
  - username: LostMedian
    content: HEY!
  - username: LostMedian
    content: '@Admin I knew you''d delete this! Why are you trying to get rid of
      this song? Don''t you know that the internet never forgets'
  - username: Troubadource
    content: I'm pretty sure that's what we're all afraid of
  - username: Folkie
    content: This is the one. @Tuottor @Troubadource @BleakMusic
  - username: Tuottor
    content: It's been up for a while, people probably spread it from here. Maybe
      one of Lost's friends spread the word like as request?
  - username: NotPop
    content: did I hit my head or something? why are you all taking this so seriously,
      this is ridiculous
  - username: Folkie
    content: SHUT UP NOTPOP
  - username: Folkie
    content: Chalk is *dead*. Or comatose or SOMETHING - that song did it to him
      and now it's on the internet for anyone to find!
  - username: NotPop
    content: it's just a *song*. he could have left for any reason
  - username: BleakMusic
    content: this is all my fault isn't it?
  - username: Tuottor
    content: Don't do this now Bleak, you had no idea.
  - username: BleakMusic
    content: But if all these people are actually dead...
  - username: NotPop
    content: legally speaking you could call this manslaughter
  - username: Folkie
    content: LEAVE US ALONE
  - username: Folkie
    content: If you aren't going to help track this thing down get out of here. I'm
      never speaking to you again.
  - username: Folkie
    content: Is it possible people uploaded the song with different details?
  - username: Troubadource
    content: Sadly, yes. The searching functionality is limited so we mostly went
      off name. Admin is looking at the databse right now but with everything going
      on there's a lot of activity which makes it hard.
