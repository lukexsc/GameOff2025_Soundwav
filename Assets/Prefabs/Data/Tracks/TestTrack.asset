    content: I'm not exactly an expert in copyright law, but I can tell you now that
      this violates several international treaties and could be, under some circumstances,
      considered a war crime. So, don't be shocked when the Hague and Europe (the
      band) come to extract every euro out of your body and soul. Nice track though.
