  description: 'If you aren''t going to make forums, admin, I''m doing it myself.


    I''m
    tired of trying to do things in separate private messages, and our mutual hacker
    friend says the site is probably not long for this world anyway so why not here.
    Let''s talk PLANS'
  comments:
  - username: Kiazhit
    content: Hey nerds, calling you all in to keep talking here @Mechang @PauseNess
      @Popek @ThrenodySkater
  - username: ThrenodySkater
    content: What about RR?
  - username: Popek
    content: He was a coward and hid his account, remember? He's not part of the
      team any more.
  - username: PauseNess
    content: Are we sure we want to talk here? Anyone can read this, including the
      mods and admin.
  - username: ThrenodySkater
    content: Like that even matters at this point.
  - username: Kiazhit
    content: Exactly, enough people are trying to find and upload the song now that
      the admin is swamped. And the mods are getting pinged as we speak. Not much
      anybody can do.
  - username: Popek
    content: "Hey, how do we feel about getting NotPop in on our Plans(TM). I've
      chatted with him on occasion and he\u2019s chill. Seems like he'd have some
      good ideas. Plus, he was at ground zero when BleakMusic uploaded the song."
  - username: PauseNess
    content: I really don't like the idea of getting more people involved.
  - username: Kiazhit
    content: Oh shut up Pause, you'll still get your chance to pick who lives and
      dies. Frankly, I would welcome some more *creative* uses for the song.
  - username: ThrenodySkater
    content: Just because killing rich assholes is obvious doesn't mean it isn't
      funny as hell.
  - username: Popek
    content: Yo @NotPop get in on this.
  - username: NotPop
    content: sup, we're posting blank tracks to have public chat rooms now? seems
      kind of unsecure
  - username: PauseNess
    content: That's what I said!
  - username: Kiazhit
    content: Hey @NotPop if you could kill anyone, who would it be?
  - username: NotPop
    content: idk Hitler?
  - username: Popek
    content: No, we mean someone who's alive now
  - username: NotPop
    content: well, there are some theories
  - username: Kiazhit
    content: Look man, I'm not really in the mood to just joke around. You've heard
      about the song, right? We happen to know a talented hacker and we're drawing
      up plans
  - username: Popek
    content: For WORLD DOMINATION
  - username: ThrenodySkater
    content: Mainly world disruption, but it's a start
  - username: NotPop
    content: lol don't tell me you've fallen for that whole deadly song thing
  - username: Kiazhit
    content: You know what. I'm just going to shortcut this whole thing. Our mutual
      friend has already run tests. I'm messaging you clips now. Sound is muted,
      obviously
  - username: NotPop
    content: that's sick
  - username: Popek
    content: I told you he'd be onboard
  - username: NotPop
    content: no, not... that's murder, like literal murder. you're murdering people
  - username: Kiazhit
    content: Yeah. And that's why we wanted to get some ideas. I'm shooting for some
      world leaders. Popek wants to settle some personal scores. And Threnody wants
      to start killing billionaires which we're saying is basic.
  - username: NotPop
    content: ok, this is new. I get that I'm edgy but I've never had to draw the
      line between that and literal mass murder before. what the hell is wrong with
      you people?
  - username: Kiazhit
    content: What's wrong with you? First of all, Popek I thought you said this guy
      was cool? Second, we stumbled on a real-life cognitohazard. It's an actual
      killer meme. And you want us to, what? Delete it? Leave it alone? It's on the
      internet already. If we don't use it first, someone else will and we'll lose
      the element of surprise.
  - username: NotPop
    content: wow. my mom was right. the people on the internet really are murderers
  - username: PauseNess
    content: See, the other downside of doing chats here is that we can't kick people
      when they're not cooperating
  - username: NotPop
    content: bored now, time for someone else to deal with this @Tuottor @Folkie
      @BleakMusic @Troubadource
  - username: Tuottor
    content: Ah, the literal psychopaths found the song. Of course.
  - username: Folkie
    content: I never thought I'd agree with NotPop, but to repeat WHAT IS WRONG WITH
      YOU PEOPLE?!! @Troubadource suspend all of them!
  - username: PauseNess
    content: I made a *private* group chat for us to talk plans. I'm logging off.
  - username: Popek
    content: You don't need to rub it in.
  - username: Kiazhit
    content: No! We would have gotten away with it too if it wasn't for you and your
      meddling mod!
  - username: Kiazhit
    content: jk, Troubadource won't be answering your messages any time soon. Or
      ever again. Did you know that you can hack the site's private messages to force
      tracks to auto-play? Troubadource is probably too busy listening to tunes.
  - username: Folkie
    content: That's... not possible. You're lying! What did you do to them?
  - username: Kiazhit
    content: Possible? My hacker friend said it was *easy*. This site is held together
      with duct tape and tissue paper. Like, did you know that if you put ${} in
      front of your user search, it shows *privated* accounts? You should be lucky
      there's no payment info stored here.
  - username: BleakMusic
    content: '@Admin your moderators are being hacked, you need to suspend these
      people!'
  - username: Kiazhit
    content: Pft, the admin never responds to @ messages. Even if they did, there's
      *way* too much going on right now.
  - username: Kiazhit
    content: Listen, in honor of you, BleakMusic, who made this all possible, I'm
      going to give you a heads-up. You should log off soon. Once the site is fully
      hacked, *everyone* is going to get a nice song in their inbox. First Soundwav,
      then the world.
  - username: Kiazhit
    content: Oh and don't bother trying to find anything about my hacker friend.
      They glitched and booby-trapped their account first-thing. I'd recommend leaving
      it alone. Anyway, hmu if you want in, but I need to check in with the others,
      ciao
  - username: Folkie
    content: 'Don''t just walk away from this, you need to answer for what you''re
      doing! '
  - username: Tuottor
    content: Folkie, there's no reasoning with them. We need to either come up with
      a plan, fast, or log off.
  - username: Folkie
    content: I'm not just going to let everyone get hit by this song like Chalk was.
      We need to figure out how to contact the admin so they can suspend the hacker
      and these jokers and stop all this.
  - username: NotPop
    content: Just an idea, but if they don't respond to messages, maybe we can interact
      with their account. It's private so that would probably get their attention.
